The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclopedia, Wikipedia. It was founded on 15 January 2001 as Wikipedia's first edition and, as of 

April 2021, has the most articles of any edition, at 6,306,989.[2] As of May 2021, 11% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-language edition. This share has 

gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003, due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.[3][4] The edition's one-billionth edit was made on 13 January 

2021.[5] The English Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of democratization of knowledge and extent of coverage.[6] It is the largest encyclopedia ever 

assembled.[6]
